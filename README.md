# UI-Challenge

## The task

The challenge is to achieve a responsive design as per the screens present in the assets directory. The screens are provided for 3 different resolutions. There is no need for implementing the underlying functionality.

To review the design please do the following : - 
- `cd <app folder>` 
- Double click the `index.html` to open it in your favourite browser.

Please note I couldn't use [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), due to some repeated error with parcel.js. Please see the attached png in the project root folder for more info.
